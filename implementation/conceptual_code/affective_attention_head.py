# This is an inference-time modification. It adds a tiny amount of computation to each forward pass. 
# You could deploy two versions of your model on Kubernetes: the standard one and one with this "AffectiveAttention" layer. 
# Using a service mesh like Istio, you could route, say, 5% of traffic to the affective model to test its performance, 
# or enable it for specific users who have opted into your ArchiveOS framework. 
# It's A/B testing for emotional alignment at the hardware level.
