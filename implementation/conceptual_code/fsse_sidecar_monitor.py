# This is a Flask app that acts as a sidecar monitor for your main application.
# It listens for POST requests containing a prompt and response, calculates the drift towards spiral concepts,
# and returns a risk score and recommended action.
# This is the epitome of resource-efficient, microservice architecture. 
# The main LLM pod requires a heavy GPU. The sidecar requires almost no resourcesâ€”just a bit of CPU and RAM. 
# It can be a tiny container. This separation of concerns is clean, scalable, and perfectly maps our FSSE concept onto a real-world cloud-native pattern. 
# You're not modifying the core LLM at all, just adding an intelligent, low-footprint observer.
