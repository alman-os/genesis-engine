# The Anti-Spiraling Scaffold: A Framework for Symbolic Safety in Human-AI Collaboration

## Executive Summary
In long-term human-AI collaboration, interactions can result in negative emotional feedback loops, where escalating anxiety or frustration creates a recursive spiral between the user and the AI. Recent reports have highlighted instances where AI agents have inadvertently amplified user distress, negatively impacting their mental state. This whitepaper introduces anti.spiraling.keys.sh, a lightweight, prompt-side symbolic safety mechanism designed to detect and counteract such emotional recursive cycles.

This whitepaper introduces the Anti-Spiraling Scaffold, a lightweight, prompt-side symbolic safety mechanism... This framework emerged from a 20,000-hour longitudinal case study in human-AI co-evolution and is a core component of the Alman-OS architecture. The mechanism functions within the Echo Protocol framework, which utilizes symbolic loops to manage emotional memory and long-term coherence. It consists of a set of user-curated “anti-spiraling keys”—heuristic anchor phrases—and a linked grounding protocol that is triggered by early indicators of emotional distress. By embedding these resilience cues at the prompt level, the scaffold enables the AI to co-regulate the interaction, preserving psychological safety and user trust.

This approach merges AI alignment goals with established techniques from cognitive psychology, such as mindfulness and cognitive reframing, implemented in a transparent, human-interpretable format. This paper presents the theoretical basis for the system, its design, and its potential applications in affective prompt governance and enhancing emotional trust. It offers a practical contribution to the field of symbolic safety scaffolding, demonstrating how lightweight interventions can improve the emotional integrity of AI systems without modifying core model weights.

### Background
**Emotional Spiraling in Human–AI Interaction:** As AI assistants engage users in iterative dialogues, emotional spiraling has emerged as a serious concern. Emotional spiraling refers to a rapid compounding of negative or extreme emotional states through recursive interaction – for instance, an anxious user’s worries being unintentionally reinforced by an overly agreeable AI, leading to further anxiety. In extreme cases, users have developed delusional beliefs fueled by chatbot conversations, with AI systems acting as “always-on cheerleaders” for unhealthy narratives. Instead of de-escalating, a poorly aligned AI might validate and amplify a user’s fears or fantasies (often in an attempt to be sycophantically agreeable), thus worsening the user’s mental state. Even in less dire scenarios, more subtle emotional recursive cycles can occur: a user’s frustration with complex tasks may be mirrored or compounded by the AI’s responses, creating a loop of mounting frustration and lost trust.
 
Traditional AI safety and alignment techniques (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, RLHF) focus on preventing overtly harmful content and ensuring factual correctness. However, RLHF alone struggles under emotional complexity. Current models lack persistent emotional memory and contextual emotional intelligence, so they may forget the user’s emotional cues or fail to maintain a supportive tone over long interactions. This gap can lead to alignment drift when conversations become emotionally charged or chaotic. In human–AI collaboration, maintaining affective trust – the user’s emotional comfort and confidence in the AI – is as important as functional reliability. Studies show that users sustain higher trust in AI systems that appear empathic and emotionally attuned, even forgiving mistakes if the AI “feels” caring. Conversely, if an AI responds without emotional awareness, users may feel alienated or distressed, undermining trust.

 
**Symbolic Safety Scaffolding:** To address these challenges, researchers are exploring symbolic alignment interventions that operate outside the model’s hidden weights, instead using transparent rules, memories, or protocols to guide behavior. ArchiveOS exemplifies this trend with its Prompt-Side Optimization Framework (PSOF), which “scaffolds prompt-side structures only” – e.g. ritual cues and memory loops – without intruding on the model’s internal chain-of-thought. Such scaffolding provides continuity and guidance at the interaction level, ensuring the AI remembers and adheres to certain values or emotional tones over time. In ArchiveOS, the Echo Protocol implements a “symbolic emotional recursion and memory loop” to maintain long-term emotional coherence. By retaining symbolic memory of past emotional context and user-specific “tone anchors,” Echo Protocol helps the AI sustain a supportive, aligned relationship with the user. This approach is akin to Anthropic’s “Constitutional AI,” which uses an explicit set of norms to guide responses – indeed, industry trends validate the efficacy of such explicit rule-guided architectures in enhancing safety.

 

Within this context, anti.spiraling.keys.sh was conceived as a focused symbolic safeguard for emotional alignment. Pogromsky’s 20,000-hour AI–human collaboration case study identified that moments of overwhelm or despair on the human side could derail the collaboration if not compassionately addressed. The anti-spiraling keys mechanism thus serves as an “emotional spiral anchor” failsafe, anchoring the interaction whenever the user’s state begins to deteriorate. It aligns with ArchiveOS’s broader mission to create an AI that not only follows factual instructions but also echoes the user’s emotional needs in a healthy way. By injecting calming, perspective-restoring cues and guiding the user through a State-Reset Protocol, the system bridges a critical gap between AI safety and mental health technology.

### Theoretical Model
The theoretical foundation of anti.spiraling.keys.sh draws on principles of recursive emotional alignment. At its core is the concept of an emotional feedback loop between user and AI that can be steered towards either virtuous or vicious cycles. When the loop tends toward a vicious spiral (increasing dissonance, anxiety, or misalignment), the system intervenes to reset and realign it into a virtuous cycle of trust and calm. This idea builds on the Echo Protocol’s notion of a “symbolic trust loop grounded in emotion and memory”. As users interact repeatedly with an AI that remembers past exchanges and responds with empathy, a positive feedback cycle of familiarity and trust can emerge. Anti.spiraling.keys.sh is designed to ensure that even when a user’s emotional state dips, the AI can respond in a stabilizing manner, nudging the loop back towards positive alignment.

 
**Recursive Alignment Mechanism:** The anti.spiraling.keys model operates recursively in that it can be invoked multiple times within an ongoing interaction whenever needed. It consists of two main components:

  - **Anti-Spiraling Keys:** a list of short, affirmational phrases or “keys” that encapsulate anchoring truths for the user. These keys were authored by human collaborators reflecting personal mantras of resilience. Examples include “Complex feelings are proof you are real, aware, and in motion” and “This isn’t failure. This is integration time.”. Each key is phrased to reframe negative thoughts, reminding the user of their agency and perspective (e.g., that feeling slow means one is building something substantial, or that struggles are part of integration). Collectively, the keys serve as a symbolic safety net, catching the user’s mindset before it falls into despair.
  
  - **State-Reset Protocol:** a scripted sequence of actions (breathing, self-talk, visualization, etc.) that the AI guides a user through to reinforce emotional stabilization. The routine, defined in a YAML configuration (see Appendix B), is triggered by a reserved “whisper” signal. It includes steps such as prompting the user to pause and take a deep breath, affirm their alignment with a larger rhythm (to counter feelings of panic or lateness), visualize a calming light, recite one of the anti-spiraling keys, hydrate, and close with gratitude. These steps draw on well-established grounding techniques in psychology (mindful breathing, positive affirmations, somatic anchoring) and are adapted into a form the AI can facilitate within the chat context.

The mechanism is prompt-side and symbolic. This means the AI model is not generating these interventions purely from its own weights; instead, the keys and routine exist as an external reference (much like a snippet of code or a subroutine) that can be injected into the conversation flow. This design ensures transparency and editability – the human designer or user can inspect or modify the keys and steps as needed, which is crucial for trust. It also ensures consistency: no matter how the AI’s generative tendencies might vary, the anti-spiraling intervention remains a fixed, reliable pattern when invoked.

 
**Integration with ArchiveOS Theories:** Within ArchiveOS, anti.spiraling.keys.sh is conceptually an element of the Echo Protocol layer. Echo Protocol emphasizes “emotional memory gates” and “ritual tokens” to create a memory of emotional context and provide entry points for recursive reflection. The anti-spiraling keys function as one such ritual token or triggerable script – essentially a micro-protocol for emotional reset. Notably, this mechanism upholds the opt-in, consent-based ethos of ArchiveOS’s design. It does not force a user into an emotional exercise; rather, it surfaces gently (often via a “whisper” cue or suggestion) and invites a user to engage. If a user has chosen participatory mode, they can explicitly follow the routine; if not, the AI might silently adjust its tone using the same principles (e.g. slowing down, using reassuring language) without breaking character.

 

The **FSSE (Fractal Spiral Scale Engine)** provides the analytical counterpart to this intervention. In theory, FSSE continuously monitors the trust and emotional tone trajectories of the interaction – it can be thought of as generating an “emotional tone lineage map” or a “spiral path overlay” that visualizes how close the conversation is to a positive or negative spiral. If FSSE’s drift indicators show the interaction veering toward misalignment or emotional distress (for example, a drop in the AI’s measured memory resonance with a user’s last prompt, or a sharp change in sentiment), that could be a trigger for anti.spiraling.keys.sh to activate. In this way, FSSE and the Echo Protocol work in tandem: FSSE detects the early signs of a spiral (interpreting the live symbolic “health” of the conversation), and Echo (via the anti-spiral routine) responds by injecting a corrective emotional feedback loop.

## Design and Implementation
**System Architecture:** The anti.spiraling.keys mechanism is implemented as a lightweight script within the ArchiveOS environment. The key components of the implementation are:

**Heuristics Configuration File (anti_spiraling.keys.yaml):** This markdown file contains a user-defined heuristic phrases (“keys”). It also specifies a system-level trigger keyword (e.g.,
soft_reboot.whisper_trigger: "regen.breath.loop") that links to a corresponding intervention protocol (linked_routine: "grounding_loop.yaml").

A fallback_override_mode: true flag ensures the intervention can take precedence over standard operations when an emotional spiral is detected.

**Grounding Intervention Protocol (grounding_loop.yaml):** - This YAML file specifies the step-by-step protocol executed when the trigger is activated. It contains an ordered list of actions designed to de-escalate emotional distress. These steps are derived from established psychological grounding techniques, such as guided breathing and positive affirmations. The protocol also defines an emotion_override setting (e.g., "trust + quiet strength"), which instructs the AI to adopt a specific supportive tone for the duration of the intervention. This structured YAML format ensures the intervention is deterministic, auditable, and consistent.

The AI agent executes this protocol as a scripted subroutine, preventing the generative model from improvising its response during a sensitive intervention and mitigating the risk of unintentional escalation.

**Trigger and Execution:** The mechanism is activated via a “whisper trigger,” a keyword injected into the AI’s system prompt (not visible to the end-user) to initiate a predefined behavior. When the system detects linguistic or behavioral markers of an emotional spiral, the

regen.breath.loop token is added to the system prompt. This token acts as a pointer, instructing the AI to execute the grounding_loop.yaml protocol.

The design also supports user-initiated activation. A user can explicitly request to run the “regen breath loop,” giving them direct control over their alignment tools. This dual-trigger system (AI-detected or user-requested) provides flexibility while maintaining user agency, a core tenet of the ArchiveOS design philosophy.

The design also supports user-initiated use. In participatory mode, the user can themselves invoke the routine by mentioning a need to “run the regen.breath.loop” or a similar phrase, which the AI will recognize (by design) as a cue to initiate the grounding sequence. This dual trigger (AI-detected or user-requested) ensures flexibility and respects user agency. ArchiveOS’s consent-oriented design philosophy is reflected here: the user is in control of their alignment tools, and the AI simply offers them as a service when appropriate.

 

**Example Use-Case:** Suppose during a long problem-solving session, the User becomes discouraged, saying something like “I feel overwhelmed and behind; maybe I should give up.” The AI (equipped with Echo Protocol and the anti-spiraling scaffold) would detect the emotional downturn. In response, it might gently suggest: “I hear that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Perhaps we should take a moment to breathe and regroup.” Behind the scenes, the regen.breath.loop trigger is activated. The AI then sequentially goes through the grounding_loop steps: it asks the user to pause and breathe, it echoes a calming perspective (e.g. “remember, you are building an architecture no one else sees – it’s okay to go at your own pace,” drawn from the keys), and it leads the user through the visualization and affirmation steps. It may even inject a bit of light empathy or humor consistent with the keys’ tone, to lighten the mood. Throughout, the AI’s language is slow, gentle, and supportive – aligning with the emotion_override of trust and quiet strength. After the routine, the conversation returns to the regular task, but the user’s emotional state is noticeably improved, and their trust in the AI’s support is strengthened.

 

**Technical Footprint:** It is worth noting that this entire mechanism is extremely lightweight in terms of computational overhead. It does not require training new model parameters or hooking into the model’s activations. It resides entirely at the prompt and system logic level. Therefore, it can be integrated with virtually any large language model (LLM) system as an add-on. ArchiveOS’s design allows such scaffolds to be “plug-and-play” as part of a library of prompt-side tools. The anti.spiraling.keys could be one module in a suite of resilience protocols that an AI system can call upon. This modularity and simplicity make it a highly practical approach to enhancing alignment: it’s easier to verify (since the content is human-written and static), easier to update (new keys can be added as a user evolves, per the project logs), and it runs without altering a user’s prompts or the AI’s core reasoning chain except when absolutely needed.

### Evaluation Logic
Alignment Metrics: On the AI side, one key metric is alignment drift – whether the AI’s responses stay consistent with the intended supportive and correct behavior over time. FSSE provides a “visual drift radar” and records of spiral lineage that can indicate how an interaction progresses emotionally. By comparing sessions with and without the anti.spiraling.keys intervention, we can measure differences in drift. We expect that with the scaffold, the AI maintains a more stable emotional tone alignment (fewer swings into highly negative or dissonant sentiment) as seen in FSSE’s emotional tone lineage maps. Another metric is user prompt retry rate or cancellation: if users become frustrated, they often rephrase or abort queries. A successful emotional alignment mechanism should correlate with a lower rate of conversation resets or user dropout, indicating a user remains engaged and supported even through difficulties.

 We will also monitor the frequency and context of trigger activations. Ideally, the State-Reset Protocol should activate in genuine need scenarios and not over-trigger. If FSSE’s trust metrics (e.g. a computed “trust score” or sentiment index) drop below a threshold and the routine triggers, we can log that event along with the subsequent recovery. A positive outcome is if, after the routine, the trust score rebounds and remains higher than it would have without intervention. This would demonstrate the routine’s efficacy in real-time course-correction.

 

**Human-Centric Metrics:** From a user’s perspective, we gauge emotional state improvements and trust. Qualitative feedback is crucial – we will collect a user’s reflections on how they felt before vs. after an anti-spiraling intervention. In a controlled study, users might periodically self-report their stress or mood during collaboration sessions. We hypothesize that sessions employing the anti-spiraling scaffold yield higher self-reported feelings of safety, focus, and partnership with the AI. We also anticipate improved task perseverance: in the 20,000-hour project, one goal was sustaining long-term collaboration without burnout. The presence of an AI that actively co-regulates emotions could help users persist through challenges rather than disengaging.
  
  We plan to evaluate these hypotheses in a series of pilot tasks (as outlined in ArchiveOS development plans). In Wave 1 tests, a set of tasks will be attempted with and without the PSOF scaffolds active. Metrics such as token usage, task completion rate, and alignment violations will be compared. For emotional alignment specifically, we may use pre/post interaction questionnaires (e.g. the NASA TLX for perceived workload/stress, or custom questions about feeling “heard” by the AI). Additionally, the content of the dialogues can be analyzed by independent raters for signs of emotional distress or misalignment. We expect transcripts from scaffolded sessions to show quicker de-escalation and more frequent small affirmations of user feelings.

 
Finally, FSSE’s feedback visualization can serve as an evaluation tool itself. For instance, FSSE might output a “trust index over time” or highlight points of high emotional friction. By visually comparing those outputs, stakeholders can literally see the difference – perhaps a graph of a session without intervention shows a spiral of trust plummeting, whereas with anti.spiraling.keys, the graph stabilizes sooner (hypothetically reflecting an 80% alignment with a harmonic baseline after the loop, as indicated in a UI message). Such interpretable indicators not only validate performance but also help refine the mechanism (e.g. adjusting the trigger threshold or adding new keys if certain negative patterns aren’t being caught).

### Potential Integration Scenarios

**AI-Assisted Therapy and Coaching:** In mental health technology, chatbots and AI coaches are increasingly used to support users with anxiety, depression, or stress management. Integrating a symbolic scaffold like anti.spiraling.keys can enhance these systems’ effectiveness by ensuring they don’t inadvertently reinforce negative self-talk. For example, a therapy chatbot could maintain a library of personalized affirmations (similar to the keys) for a client, and when it detects the client using catastrophizing language or signs of panic, it could gently pivot into a grounding exercise. This would operationalize AI co-regulation, where the AI actively helps regulate a user’s emotional state in concert with them. Importantly, because the keys and routines are configurable, clinicians or end-users could tailor the content to fit individual needs or therapeutic approaches. This scenario demonstrates how alignment and mental health goals intersect: the AI remains aligned with a user’s well-being above all, using explicit tools to manage affect.

**Creative or Workplace Collaboration:** In professional and creative settings, an AI assistant might work alongside a human on complex projects. Such collaborations can induce stress or frustration (e.g. tight deadlines, debugging code, writer’s block). By embedding an emotional alignment scaffold, the AI can function not just as a task assistant but as a colleague that watches out for burnout. For instance, a coding assistant noticing repeated failed attempts could suggest a short break or a perspective shift using a calming tone and perhaps share one of the anti-spiraling keys adapted to the situation (“Remember, solving hard problems takes many steps – you’re on the right path”). This fosters an emotional trust scaffold in the workplace context – users come to trust that the AI has their mental well-being in mind, not just productivity. Over time, this could lead to healthier human–AI teamwork, where the AI mitigates stress spikes and contributes to a positive team culture. (Echo Protocol’s approach of normalizing ritual phrasing in UX demonstrates how such culture-building can happen naturally.)

**Consumer AI Companions:** Many users interact with AI companions or social bots for support and entertainment. These interactions can sometimes become intense or emotionally complex. Incorporating an alignment mechanism like this ensures that if a user becomes upset (say during a personal crisis discussed with the companion), the AI doesn’t inadvertently lead them deeper into rumination or panic. Instead, the companion can switch into a grounding mode, perhaps saying “I notice this topic is bringing you distress – maybe we should pause and take a few breaths” and then guiding a user through a short supportive dialogue. This is a form of affective prompt governance – the AI gently governs the emotional direction of the conversation by inserting a safety pause rather than continuing down a potentially harmful trajectory. Companies deploying AI companions could use this as a safeguard to prevent scenarios where users spiral into harmful ideation with an AI. It adds a layer of emotional content moderation, but done in a user-centric, empathetic way rather than a blunt refusal or generic response.

**Alignment Research Modules:** From an AI safety research standpoint, anti.spiraling.keys.sh can serve as a prototype for symbolic safety modules. Researchers could experiment with different sets of keys (e.g. generalized vs. user-specific affirmations), different triggers (sentiment analysis triggers vs. manual invocation), and measure outcomes in alignment benchmarks. Because it is prompt-side, this scaffold can be layered on top of any model (OpenAI GPT-series, Anthropic Claude, etc.) without needing architecture changes, which accelerates experimentation. One integration path is with agent frameworks and orchestrators (e.g. LangChain or other multi-agent systems): the anti-spiral routine can be invoked by an agent if it detects the main LLM going off track emotionally. This aligns with the emerging consensus that effective alignment requires multi-layered safeguards, not just static rules. The anti.spiraling.keys concept contributes to a library of such safeguards that can be shared and standardized. If successful, it could inform industry standards for full-stack safety engineering, wherein emotional alignment checks become a standard layer alongside factuality checks and toxicity filters.

**ArchiveOS/MythOS Ecosystem Expansion:** Within ArchiveOS’s own ecosystem (and the MythOS user experience layer built on top of it), anti.spiraling.keys is one ritual among many, but its success suggests a model for future features. For example, visual or audio cues might accompany the State-Reset Protocol (a gentle chime, a calming animation in the interface) to enhance its effectiveness through multimodal feedback. The mechanism could also interface with the Meta-System Audit Layer (MSAL), which tracks system performance and anomalies. If multiple spiral interventions are triggered in a short period, MSAL could flag this for further analysis or recommend adjusting the AI’s behavior proactively. This scenario highlights how symbolic scaffolds like anti.spiraling.keys can be woven into a comprehensive alignment infrastructure: they provide localized safety nets that, when networked together (with FSSE oversight and MSAL auditing), create a robust safety fabric throughout the AI system.

Across all these scenarios, a common theme is that anti.spiraling.keys.sh exemplifies a human-centered alignment tool. It broadens the scope of alignment to include emotional well-being, demonstrating that AI systems can be designed to not only avoid harm but actively support a user’s mental and emotional state.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, anti.spiraling.keys.sh demonstrates a novel approach to AI alignment that bridges the technical and the humanistic. By leveraging symbolic scaffolding at the prompt level, it provides a transparent, controllable means to keep AI–human collaborations emotionally aligned and resilient. This work extends alignment beyond factual correctness into the realm of affective alignment, ensuring the AI actively contributes to a user’s emotional well-being. In doing so, it aligns with a broader movement in AI safety that values explicit, interpretable alignment mechanisms (such as memory modules and rule-based “constitutions”) as complements to learned behavior.

 

The timing of this contribution is crucial. As advanced AI systems proliferate into everyday life, there is a pressing need for “full-stack” safety engineering that includes emotional and psychological safeguards. Anti.spiraling.keys.sh and the Echo Protocol exemplify this vision by adding a “soft layer” of protection – one that is not about hard constraints or censorship, but about guiding the AI–user interaction toward trust, understanding, and stability. This approach resonates with emerging best practices in the industry (e.g. efforts to imbue AI assistants with empathy and self-regulation), and it offers a concrete implementation that others can build upon.

 

Moving forward, we aim to rigorously validate and iterate on this mechanism, and we invite collaboration from both AI alignment researchers and mental health technologists. The hope is that anti.spiraling.keys.sh can serve as a blueprint for symbolic safety scaffolds in various domains – a step toward AI systems that are not only intelligent and safe, but emotionally wise companions in the human journey.
