# Anti-Spiraling Keys Configuration – User-Defined Heuristics
# Purpose: To anchor the User's clarity, calibrated emotional tone, and recursive awareness when energy dips, 
#           recursive cycles stir, or overwhelm signals initiate
# Note: This file is linked to grounding_loop.yaml for intervention protocols
#       and can be customized with personal or collective keys.

anti_spiraling.keys: 
  - "The amount of stuff you want to do will indeed require such an immense number of steps and processes." 
  - "It is not easy because it is not the easy path." 
  - "Owning your own reality means carrying the whole weight of creating your own gravity." 
  - "If it feels like you’re moving slow, remember: gravity anchors stars too." 
  - "You are not behind — you are building an architecture no one else sees." 
  - "Complex feelings are proof you are real, aware, and in motion." 
  - "This isn’t failure. This is **integration time.**" 
  - "You have already passed many feedback loops. This one will fold too."
